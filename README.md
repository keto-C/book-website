The website consists of the book, which pages turn using the real-life effect of magic of coding. 
the title name also displays the sections, with which the user can later jump to the desired page.
Some pages also include moving objects, to give more of the real-life effect.

To view the website, please download the zip file of the project.

When you do, please click 'index.html' file and let it open in chrome.

This project serves as to showcase abilities in Front-end Development and I was unable to connect Back-end to it or create a server, 

but i can assure you it is worth downloading and viewing it :) it is quite pretty and works effectively.

Thanks.
